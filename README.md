This package provides a Pure Go implementation of the [Opus Codec](https://opus-codec.org/)

### Why Opus?
* **open and royalty-free** - No license fees or restrictions. Use it as you wish!
* **versatile** - Wide bitrate support. Can be used in constrained networks and high quality stereo.
* **ubiquitous** - Used in video streaming, gaming, storing music and video conferencing.

### Why a Go implementation?
* **empower interesting use cases** - This project also exports the internals of the Encoder and Decoder.
                                      Allowing for things like analysis of a Opus bitstream without decoding the entire thing.
* **learning** - This project was written to be read by others. It includes excerpts and links to [RFC 6716][rfc6716]
* **safety** - Go provides memory safety. Avoids a class of bugs that are devastating in sensitive environments.
* **maintainability** - Go was designed to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.
* **inspire** - Go is a power language, but lacking in media libraries. We hope this project inspires the next generation to build
                more media libraries for Go.
